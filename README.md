## Chess GUI

Chess GUI built on top of the engine provided by Elias Floreteng at https://github.com/INDAPlus21/eliasfl-chess.

To start up the application, type `cargo run` in the directory.
What it looks like:

![Chess UI](/resources/chess-gui.png)

where the highlighted green tiles are the possible moves for the black knight at f4.

You play the game like this:

1. click on the piece you want to move
2. click on the tile that you want to move the clicked piece to

If you clicked on a piece and regret it, just click on the piece again to unselect it.

- Start a new game by clicking on reset
- if you are playing as white and want to change your promotion piece, wait until it's your turn and then select what you want.
